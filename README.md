# PLC Security Research Artifacts

This repository hosts a list of the publicly available artifacts related to PLC security research. The purpose of this repository is:

* Highlight and recognize the authors who have put in the effort to release their research artifacts (source code, experimental data, etc). 
* Provide the research community with a centralized PLC security artifact list.
* Encourage and foster other authors to release their research artifacts so that the community can replicate results and built upon them.
